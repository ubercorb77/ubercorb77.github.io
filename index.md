# Welcome to my github pages thing

Hello! I am very new to github so this site visually won't be the best. This isn't such a serious website, it's just a collection of my personal projects.

I'll be updating this. If an item is listed here but there's no link, that probably means I'll be uploading the file soon.

## YouTube channel
- [ubercorb77](https://youtube.com/c/ubercorb77panda/videos)
  - I upload fun and serious bowling videos here. Usually the serious videos are me explaining my opinions using some analysis.

## Javascript
- [Bowling Scores Calc](bowlingScoreCalc.html) (calculate total, games, avg, +/- 200)

## Google Sheets
### Calculators
- [Dual Angle / Pin Buffer conversion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ps0zo3vpZN99l0kZYcBa-ZYu2aUZIzsjTYAIoCsKqUY/edit?usp=sharing) (
- [Analysis of Ball Weight vs Carry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16qTBZFGV6j69rFYmjWMh0AdQJvjtEfsbdGXGdWY-iVo/edit?usp=sharing) (inspiration and equations from Bowling Beyond the Basics)
- Swing + Slide dynamics (a physics analysis of how timing affects ball speed)
  - I think this spreadsheet has some problems with the body speed becoming negative but I'm going to make a new one anyway and the new one shouldn't have that problem and the new one will be more accurate
  - This spreadsheet uses Euler's method (breaks up the problem into many little, simpler steps to get a good estimation)
  - But I am working on a new version that will use calculus (solve the whole problem, without estimating)
- [Spare Targets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sZUKxdddEp4zYlZGXfuI75RjdbisBEGYA3skklf41mw/edit?usp=sharing) (where you should target for different pins if you throw 100% straight)
  - Sheets 1-2 are calculators, 3rd sheet is data/results from 2nd sheet calculator

### Data only (view only, not a calculator)
- [Spare Targets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sZUKxdddEp4zYlZGXfuI75RjdbisBEGYA3skklf41mw/edit?usp=sharing) (where you should target for different pins if you throw 100% straight)
  - Sheets 1-2 are calculators, 3rd sheet is data/results from 2nd sheet calculator

## 3D printing
- Bowling Mini Pro-Sect
  - measures 3.5 inches on each side, total of 7 inches
  - 0.25 inches width
  - 0.5 inches width: with middle line, with modified middle line
- Phone Stand (insert measurements)
  - custom designed for the measurements of an iPhone XS with a Spigen Liquid Air case.
  - 13mm depth and 70-110.5mm width
- Phone Stand 2
  - adjustable but not as secure
  - 0-34mm depth

## TI-Basic
These are text files of the code. These are my versions of the game, and there are probably more efficient ways to code these.
