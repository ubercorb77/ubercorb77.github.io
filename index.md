# Welcome to my github pages thing

Hello! I am very new to github. This isn't such a serious website, it's just a collection of my coding projects and it helps me access my javascript projects on my phone.

## Javascript
- [Bowling Scores Calc](bowlingScoreCalc.html) (calculate total, games, avg, +/- 200)

## Google Sheets
### Calculators
- [Dual Angle / Pin Buffer conversion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ps0zo3vpZN99l0kZYcBa-ZYu2aUZIzsjTYAIoCsKqUY/edit?usp=sharing) (
- Analysis of Ball Weight vs Carry (inspiration and equations from Bowling Beyond the Basics)
- Swing + Slide dynamics (a physics analysis of how timing affects ball speed)
  - This spreadsheet uses Euler's method (breaks up the problem into many little, simpler steps to get a good estimation)
  - But I am working on a new version that will use calculus (solve the whole problem, without estimating)
- Spare Targets (where you should target for different pins if you throw 100% straight)
  - 1st sheet is a calculator

### Data only (view only, not a calculator)
- Spare Targets (where you should target for different pins if you throw 100% straight)
  - 2nd sheet is data only

## TI-Basic
(text files of code)
These are my versions of the game. There are probably more efficient ways to code these.

- [Snake](snake ti basic.txt)
